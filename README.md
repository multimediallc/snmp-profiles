# ktranslate-profiles
This repo contains configuration files that define how KTranslate polls information from specific network devices. [This tutorial](https://github.com/kentik/ktranslate/wiki/Tutorial:-Writing-a-custom-yaml-file-for-SNMP) contains more information about how to create an SNMP profile for a new device type. You can also check out this heavily commented [template profile](https://github.com/kentik/snmp-profiles/blob/main/profiles/kentik_snmp/_template.yml) for examples of the fields and configurations you can include in your profiles.  

## NOTE: This repo is no longer actively creating new profiles based on requests in issues. We will accept pull requests from the community for new profiles but cannot create any more ourselves.
